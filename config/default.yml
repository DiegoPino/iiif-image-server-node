  # public: Use the project's public directory. This can be useful for allowing

  # Options for cleaning the cache with the clean_iiif_cache script which uses
  # a iiif-image profile.yml document to determine which files to clean out.
  # There are two different time differences both measured in days.
  clean:
    # profile_image: Number of milliseconds old a profile image needs to be
    # before it is cleaned from the cache.
    # Since the profile images are intended to be
    # for commonly used images in your application you may want to set this
    # to a relatively high number, but can lower it if you need to reclaim
    # cache storage space more aggressively. Default is 30 days.
    profile_image: 2592000000
    # random_image: This is the setting for images that are not in your profile
    # so images that are not commonly used in your application. These could be
    # tile images from your pan/zoom viewer or images from an old profile. Set
    # this number to as high as you can while not exceeding your storage space.
    # Default is one day.

resolver:
  # Source image resolver. If the base_path is falsey then the images directory
  # in this project will be used. Any other value ought to be the full base
  # path for resolving images.
  base_path: false
  # Valid values for type include:
  # simple: For using the full identifier name as the name of the file directly
  #         underneath the base_path.
  # nested: Takes the nested_number number of characters off the front of the
  #         filename and uses that as the top level directory. This can be
  #         useful for partitioning your access derivative images.
  # pairtree: Follows the Pairtree spec in splitting up an identifier into
  #           nested directory names two characters at a time.

# Do you want to allow images to be resized above the size of the extracted
# region? You can change this factor to allow upscaling up to
# upsize_factor * params.region.w
# A value of 1 means that no upsizing will be allowed.
# So an upsize_factor of 2 would allow extracted regions to be upsized to no
# more than twice their size. This number is used to check the validity
# of the incoming request and reject any requests for images that are too large.
# Note that if you begin with a larger upsize_factor and then decrease this
# number you may have to clear your image cache as with some settings
# (cache.image.base_path == 'public') the image server code that checks for this
# may never see the request as the web server might be serving static assets
# directly out of the public directory.
